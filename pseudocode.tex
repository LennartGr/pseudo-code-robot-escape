\section{Definitions}
We use the term \textit{center line} to describe the line depicted in the graphic below: \\

\section{Sub-Routine \textit{scan()}}
The robot gradually does a full rotation, meanwhile creating a list of measurements. 
It stores the current distance captured by the sensor, then it rotates for a fixed angle
$\phi$ (e.g. $\phi = 1 \degree$) until the robot has completed a full rotation.
$\phi$ should be chosen as divider of $2 \pi = 360 \degree$ so that the robot returns to the original gaze direction after the scan.

\section{Technical remarks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The robot does never know certainly whether it passed the door, so the outer loop is rather \enquote{while(true)}. The robot is stopped externally as soon as it passed the door. 
	\item TODO what is a door-like pattern
\end{itemize}
